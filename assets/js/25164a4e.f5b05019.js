In this post I will walkthrough you about what a developer (let\u2019s omit the word \u2019software\u2019) is and how to determine if you are one of them and potentially how to become.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to let you know firstly that becoming in such thing is not easy at all, specially right now, it will take time\u2026 A LOT! Maybe you are student at college, university, taking courses, well, that\u2019s fantastic! But let me tell you something, NOBODY cares about your diplomas, at end, you will need to show your skills in a technical interview, no matter what.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nNow! After this big uppercut punch, let\u2019s go to what is important.\\r\\nYou will have to enjoy learning, this is the rule number one. Why? Well, that\u2019s because technology doesn\u2019t have breaks, have you ever seen those memes about iPhone 1, 5, 20, 85 and so on\u2026 well, same happens with technologies, today you know something, one way to do it and tomorrow is totally different, this is usually called \u2019versioning\u2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce said, you will have no problems at all, but here is a bunch of things that you must know religiously.\\r\\nSource control.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease, don\u2019t expect that interviewers are going to ask you this, they will assume you already know it. Must developers, teams and projects use git or TFS. Preferably git. Investigate, learn it. This is important. Here is a good resource to learn\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\ngit init\\r\\ngit clone [url]\\r\\ngit add [file]\\r\\ngit commit -m \\"[message]\\"\\r\\ngit status\\r\\ngit diff\\r\\ngit pull\\r\\ngit push\\r\\ngit branch\\r\\ngit checkout [branch]\\r\\ngit merge [branch]\\r\\ngit remote -v\\r\\ngit log\\r\\ngit reset [file]\\r\\ngit rm [file]\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Databases\\r\\n\\r\\nMost developers must know at least one database, SQL, MySQL, Mongo\u2026 in my case I love SQL and Mongo, both are fine, however this is quite important because is where all your information will be saved.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are learning SQL, good! Find some technical interview questions and try to understand why they are asking such questions. This is not just SELECT (ALL) FROM, blah blah blah, no learn serious things, do follow tutorial that say \u2018How to create a SIMPLE table\u2019 better find a tutorial that says \u2018How to create a table and\u2026 so on\u2019, majority of developer\u2019s duties don\u2019t include creating a simple table, that doesn\u2019t exist!\\r\\n\\r\\nOK! I don\u2019t mean you will never create it and you never learn the basics, but once you know that basics go forwards.\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n    <li>[MongoDB](https://learn.mongodb.com)</li>\\r\\n    <li>[SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n### Choose a programing language\\r\\n\\r\\nI have chosen C# and [javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), because I love them, both provide me the flexibility I want in different scenarios. For the back-end I work with C# and [javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for the front-end. I love **Angular** BTW.\\r\\n\\r\\nLean Angular or React! (I am not big fan of React)\\r\\n\\r\\nThese two are very high well demanded. For both you will need to know [javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and potentially Typescript.\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n    <li>[Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)</li>\\r\\n    <li>[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not choose a programming language just because it is trending, it is important to know what each language is capable of and what scope it has.\\r\\nYou can take a look at this website [https://roadmap.sh/](https://roadmap.sh/) to have better idea about what makes for fit for you.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\nDid I mention Angular? You will also need to know this two guys\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n    <li>[rxjs.dev](https://rxjs.dev/)</li>\\r\\n    <li>[ngrx.io](https://ngrx.io/)</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are still alive after learning these things here is your dessert graphql\\r\\n\\r\\nStyle your app\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is something you can learn in way, but we cannot ignore it\\r\\n\\r\\nCSS\\r\\nSASS\\r\\n\\r\\n### Design patterns\\r\\n\\r\\nThis another crucial part of your developer path. Hey! Guess what! Universities don\u2019t teach this!\\r\\nYou might want to take a look at this site https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns to understand what are they for.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Security\\r\\n\\r\\nI am tired to say this is important! Everything is important! Just learn things from this website https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/ we also need to fight against hackers! We make sure the software is secure.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Let\u2019s move to API!\\r\\n\\r\\nOk ok! You can work the backend without learning other programming language, that\u2019s up to you! But if you want to be a demanded software developer (GOOD resource). You might always choose C#, JAVA, Python or any other you feel comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/csharp\\r\\nhttps://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/aspnet\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Microservices\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/microservices\\r\\nhttps://docs.docker.com/get-started/\\r\\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/\\r\\n\\r\\n#### SCRUM and Kanban\\r\\n\\r\\nLearn agile methodologies!\\r\\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/agile/tutorials/how-to-do-scrum-with-jira-software\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is something you will deal every day of your life.\\r\\nAnd finally!\\r\\n\\r\\nLearn technical interview questions and make practical tests also, hackerrank is good resource to have an excellent headache.\\r\\nhttps://www.hackerrank.com/\\r\\nNow, if you manage in decent percentage these things! Congrats! You are software developer! Companies will be happy to hire you! BTW there were the basics. There much more I didn\u2019t mention in this article like Azure, AWS, Unit Test\u2026 and so many other things! But you will figure out later!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you got to here, maybe you are wondering, why I must know all these things, well, it is because \u2018we\u2019 as developer, compete between each other, to get a project, to get a better position, to have better wage\u2026 among other reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::info\\r\\n\\r\\nI must say that there are many other things about software development that are necessary to secure a full stack position in a company or for your project. But at least with this you have a clear vision of what it is and where to start.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for reading and happy coding!"},{"id":"why-do-i-need-sorftware-architecture","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/blog/why-do-i-need-sorftware-architecture","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/02-27-2024/software-architecture.md","source":"@site/blog/02-27-2024/software-architecture.md","title":"Why do I need to know about Software Architecture","description":"One of the biggest problems when developing an application is the architecture.

Many developers make the mistake of starting to develop an application without considering the architecture first.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Chaos!](./102235.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may mean having to work more for many people, but over time, it is something of utmost importance, especially as the application grows.\\r\\nMaking architecture decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n```ts\\r\\n// Define API endpoints without clear organization\\r\\nconst apiEndpoint1 = \'https://api.example.com/endpoint1\';\\r\\nconst apiEndpoint2 = \'https://api.example.com/endpoint2\';\\r\\nconst apiEndpoint3 = \'https://api.example.com/endpoint3\';\\r\\n\\r\\n// Call API 1 without understanding its purpose or expected data format\\r\\nfetch(apiEndpoint1)\\r\\n  .then(response => {\\r\\n    // Forget to check for errors or handle response data properly\\r\\n    processData(response.data);\\r\\n  })\\r\\n  .catch(error => {\\r\\n    // No error handling, let errors propagate\\r\\n    console.error(\'Error calling API 1:\', error.message);\\r\\n  });\\r\\n\\r\\n// Call API 2 with incorrect parameters and no error handling\\r\\nfetch(apiEndpoint2 + \'?param=abc\')\\r\\n  .then(response => response.json())\\r\\n  .then(data => {\\r\\n    // Attempt to access undefined properties of response data\\r\\n    console.log(\'Data from API 2:\', data.result);\\r\\n  });\\r\\n\\r\\n// Attempt to call API 3 synchronously \\r\\n// without waiting for responses from APIs 1 and 2\\r\\nconst response3 = fetch(apiEndpoint3).json();\\r\\n// Forget to await response, resulting in undefined data\\r\\nconsole.log(\'Data from API 3:\', response3);\\r\\n\\r\\n// Proceed without understanding API rate limits or authentication requirements\\r\\n// Risking API throttling or unauthorized access\\r\\n\\r\\n// And finally, wonder why the code is not working as expected\\r\\nconsole.log(\\"This is chaos! We need better API management!\\"); // TOO LATE!!!!\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAn architect is expected to define the architecture *decisions* and *designed principles* used to guide technology decisions within the team the department or across the enterprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuide is the key operative word in this first expectation. An architect should guide rather than specify technology choices. For example, an architect might take a decision to use react JS for front end development. In this case, the architect is making a technical decision rather than an architectural decision or design principle that will help the development team making choices.\\r\\nBut why we need it? \\r\\n\\r\\n### Let\u2019s try to visualize it in a real-world scenario. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet\u2019s image you are a millionaire person, and you want to build a 20 floors hotel, however you don\u2019t know anything about building hotels or maybe you do, or partially you might know what you need:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li>Excavation contractor</li>\\r\\n<li>Steel or concrete structure contractor</li>\\r\\n<li>Concrete contractor</li>\\r\\n<li>Masonry contractor</li>\\r\\n<li>Mechanical and electrical installations contractor, among others</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat! They know how to build stuff! With those guys it is enough to build the hotel. Well, unfortunately that\u2019s not how it works if you want to build your 20 floors hotel correctly, avoid future problems, and make stable and scalable, it is true excavation contractor know how to excavate, steel and concrete contractor know how to manage steel and concrete, same with the rest, but, where, when and why is the question for this scenario.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Chaos!](./101524.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n#### The excavation contractor, eager to start work, begins digging the foundation without conducting a thorough site survey. As a result, they encounter unexpected underground obstacles such as utility lines and rock formations, leading to delays and additional costs for relocation and blasting.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### The steel and concrete contractors, eager to make progress, start erecting the building\'s structure before the structural plans are fully approved by the architect and engineer. This results in discrepancies between the actual construction and the approved plans, leading to structural integrity concerns and the need for costly modifications later on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the construction process, there is a lack of comprehensive quality control measures and inspections to identify and address issues promptly. As a result, construction defects go unnoticed until later stages, leading to costly rework and potential safety hazards for occupants.\\r\\nLike these can be many scenarios, and guess what, the same happens in **software development**.\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine every contractor as a **developer**, front-end developer, back-end developer, database developer, quality assurance and so on, all these members are good in every field, however, if they do not have someone that guides all the construction (software development), possibly your 20 floors hotel will collapse in one moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, that\u2019s why it is always important to have a software architecture to guide the construction in every moment. \\r\\n\\r\\n:::danger[Don\'t]\\r\\n\\r\\nDO NOT make the same mistake to tell you team hurry up! this is urgent, hurry up! we need it for tomorrow because this is what happens you want everything fast. \\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\nIf you want a nice book about this, I recommend **Fundamental of Software Architecture** from O\u2019Reilly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHappy coding!!"}]}')}}]);
