# How to find collaborators without compromising the security

### How to find collaborators without compromising the security of your idea

In this chapter, we will address one of the most common challenges for entrepreneurs, how to find international without compromising the security of your innovative idea. We will explore effective strategies for establishing strong international collaborations while protecting your intellectual assets.

International collaboration offers access to a wide range of talent and perspectives, as well as opportunities to expand into new markets. However, many entrepreneurs hesitate to seek collaborators outside their borders due to fear that their ideas will be stolen. The basis of any successful collaboration is mutual trust. From the beginning, it is crucial to establish clear and transparent communication with your international. Use safe communication tools like our internal chat and share your expectations and concerns openly without divulging your idea.

Before engaging with an international collaborator, conduct thorough research on their professional history and credentials. Look for references, review previous projects, and check their experience in the field relevant to your project. For this reason we always recommend having an updated profile with experiences and work history.
