# Differences between monetize and non monetize

**Monetized Open Source Projects vs. Non-Monetized Open Source Projects**

| Aspect                   | Monetized Open Source Projects       | Non-Monetized Private Projects   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Objective**            | Primary aim is generating revenue through various monetization strategies such as licensing, support services, consulting, or additional features. | Primarily focused on community contribution, collaboration, and the advancement of technology without a direct revenue motive. |
| **Funding Model**        | Often funded through commercialization strategies where certain aspects of the project may be proprietary, or through donations, sponsorships, or grants. | Typically relies on volunteer efforts, donations, sponsorships, and occasionally grants to support development and maintenance costs. |
| **License**              | May use more restrictive licenses to protect revenue streams, such as dual licensing or proprietary add-ons alongside open source components. | Usually employs permissive licenses like MIT, Apache, or GNU GPL, promoting freedom to use, modify, and distribute software. |
| **Community Engagement** | Emphasizes customer relationships, user feedback, and community involvement, often tailored towards the needs and requirements of paying customers. | Prioritizes inclusive collaboration, open communication, and merit-based contributions from a diverse community of developers. |
| **Development Focus**    | Development efforts may be directed towards features or enhancements that align with revenue-generating opportunities or the needs of commercial users. | Development focus is typically driven by the interests, needs, and contributions of the community, often aiming to solve common problems or address emerging challenges. |
| **Long-term Sustainability** | Sustainability is closely tied to maintaining revenue streams, which may require continuous adaptation to market demands and customer preferences. | Sustainability relies on maintaining an active and engaged community, fostering a culture of contribution, and securing funding through various means to support ongoing development and maintenance. |
